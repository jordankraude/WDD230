            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
            <h3>The Coca Cola Company</h3>
            <!--The company name-->
            <h3><a href="https://us.coca-cola.com/">https://us.coca-cola.com/</a></h3>

            <!--mobile view screenshot-->
            <p>Coca Cola uses visual hierarchy by placing the things they want in the viewers vision in plain white
                and in big bold text. This draws the users attention from the less important information right below it.
                The ad then draws the attention of the user again to something else that they want us to view as important
                in the "Learn More" button below that makes the user want to push it.

            <!--mobile view screenshot-->
            <p>This website by Tesla is a good example to show how proximity can be a good tool. Simply put they
                put the existing supply and the order buttons close together to show relation and importance of those
                two together.

            <!--mobile view screenshot-->
            <p>United airlines keeps everything aligned to make the website look good and attractive to the user. They
                keep their form all aligned with the rest of the page so they know the form is the main attraction/main
                thing to get attention. In the form they keep a proffesional look by keeping the form elements aligned with
                each other and with the other elements of the webpage.
